a = input("Enter the value of a")
b = input("Enter the value of b")

if a > b :
    print("Maximum value is " , a)  
    # print(f"Maximum value is {a} . Here is the maximum value ") This is the easy way to print both our statement with variable .
    # The syntax is very simple , we simply have to write 'f' in starting 
else :
    print("Maximum value is " ,b)
